#while the assignment tips say that we should only type down the phone balance and the cost as variables i also think that we should know first if the user wants to call
#i personally thought that the code without the line below would have felt a little vague.
phone = input("do you wanna phone someone (yes or no): ")
# a balance variable here as well because if the user said no then we will just say that his balance is zero to remind them that they are poor
balance = 0
#then i felt like adding conditions to our code of course we wouldn't have needed it if we just had 2 variables (balance and cost)
if phone.lower() == "yes":
    # the user then enters the balance
    balance = float(input("please input your balance: "))
    # and the cost as well
    cost = float(input("please input your cost: "))
    #the math should be right though that is why we used IF here so the users balance is more than the calls cost otherwise we would call them poor
    if balance >= cost:
        remaining = balance - cost
        print("your balance is: ", remaining)
    #an else here if the user is poor like me.
    else:
        print("oof you are poor you can't call anyone and no one cares")
#another else because what if the user chose no we can also say elif phone == "no" but yea
else:
    print(f"well have a great day then mate your balance stays the same Balance : {balance}")
input("press enter key to exit")
